                        Scrum principles are pivotal in guiding Obii Kriationz in product management
                        practices, enabling us to stay agile, customer-focused, and highly efficient
                        in delivering top-notch products and services. Scrum principles in product management
                        have gained significant popularity due to their effectiveness in enhancing
                        collaboration, adaptability, and efficiency within product development teams.
                        Scrum, initially a framework for agile software development, has found its
                        applications well beyond software and into broader product management contexts.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Scrum is rooted in the idea that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on
                        what is known. It promotes transparency, inspection, and adaptation. Teams continually inspect
                        their work, adapt their processes, and make improvements based on the outcomes of each sprint.
                        Scrum divides the project into small, manageable increments built and delivered iteratively.
                        Each increment, or sprint, adds new functionality or improvements. This approach allows for
                        early and frequent delivery of valuable features, reducing the time to market.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Scrum teams are self-organizing, meaning they can decide how to accomplish their work. Team
                        members collaborate to determine the best approach for achieving sprint goals. This principle
                        fosters a sense of ownership, responsibility, and motivation within the team.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Scrum encourages collaboration between cross-functional team members, stakeholders, and
                        customers. Close collaboration helps ensure that the product being developed aligns with
                        customer needs and business goals. Regular feedback and communication are essential to Scrum's
                        success. Scrum teams regularly reflect on their processes and performance during Sprint
                        Retrospectives. They identify areas for improvement and take action to make necessary
                        adjustments. Continuous improvement is central to Scrum's philosophy.

                            Roles - Scrum defines specific roles for team members. These include the Product Owner,
                            Scrum Master, and Development Team. The Product Owner is responsible for determining the
                            product vision and priorities, the Scrum Master ensures that the Scrum process is followed
                            and helps remove impediments, and the Development Team creates the product.

                            Artefacts - Scrum uses various artefacts to facilitate communication and transparency. The
                            most common artefacts include the Product Backlog (a prioritized list of work items), the
                            Sprint Backlog (a subset of the Product Backlog items selected for a sprint), and the
                            Increment (the product incrementally developed during a sprint).

                            Sprints - Scrum organizes work into time-boxed iterations called "sprints." Sprints are
                            typically 2-4 weeks long and provide a fixed timeframe for the team to deliver a potentially
                            shippable product increment. At the end of each sprint, a review and retrospective are held
                            to assess progress and make improvements.

                            include Sprint Planning (to plan the work for the upcoming sprint), Daily Standup (short
                            daily sessions to discuss progress), Sprint Review (to demonstrate the work completed during
                            the sprint), and Sprint Retrospective (to reflect on the sprint and identify areas for
                            improvement).

                            Empirical Process Control - Scrum relies on empiricism, meaning that decisions are based on
                            observed data and experience rather than speculation. Teams use feedback from each sprint to
                            adapt and make improvements in subsequent sprints.
